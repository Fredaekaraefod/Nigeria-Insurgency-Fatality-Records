# Nigeria Insurgency Fatality Records

### 🎯 Project Purpose
This repository is a structured research initiative to compile *publicly verified* data on killings linked to the Boko Haram insurgency in Northern Nigeria (2009–present).  
The goal is to build a transparent, research-grade dataset that documents what has been recorded—and more importantly—what has been forgotten.
